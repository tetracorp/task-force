_Task Force_ (or _Taskforce_) is a turn-based squad shooter game created by Mark
Sheeky for the Commodore Amiga. Mark produced a huge number of Amiga games under
the Scorpius Software brand between 1991 and 1997, mostly freeware or shareware,
before moving on to PC games.

### This project

This website is similar to my previous Commodore Amiga game analysis projects,
[Exploring K240](https://tetracorp.github.io/k240/) and
[Exploring the Dungeons of Avalon](https://tetracorp.github.io/dungeons-of-avalon/).

For _Task Force_, the in-game instructions hinted at useful stats hidden from
the player:

> Write to me if you want lists of the standard computer agents equipment. There
> are 5 types of computer agent. Normal, Big Gun, Elite, Android, and Captain.
> Each have different equipment specs [...]
>
> Write to me if you want the enemy intelligence algorithms, enemy
> specification, the formats for the mission files, the music modules or
> specific routines. If you have any suggestions for possible sequels or if you
> would like to see a full price version, contact me too.

From a [2011 interview](https://www.amigapd.com/interview-mark-sheeky.html) we
know that a few people actually did write to the game's author, leading to
the games _Hilt_ and _Hilt 2_. In 2022, he published the source code on the
game's [Itch.io page](https://marksheeky.itch.io/taskforce),
which will make analysis of this game much easier! It's released under the CC
BY-NC 4.0 license (free for non-commercial use), and the game is sold on a "pay
what you want" basis.

I encourage other Amiga game developers to release their old games this way on
Itch.io, along with source code, if it still survives. You might receive a few
tips from nostalgic players of your game from back in the day, or at least you
can bless the Amiga community with a piece of history.

Next, see [history](../about/history.html) for an article on the game itself,
or see the [index](https://tetracorp.github.io/task-force/) for analysis and
data.
