### Free money bug

On the loadout screen, click on an item you bought and hit DISCARD to get a
refund. The button will still say DISCARD, and you can keep clicking it to sell
the item. You can even select other characters and give them large amounts of
money.

The most money you'll ever need on one character is 24, for eight items costing
3 each.
