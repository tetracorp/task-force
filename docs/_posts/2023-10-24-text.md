task force

intro music by mark sheeky.

task force is a mission based
wargame in which you control 1
to 5 allied agents against a
far bigger computer controlled
force.,0,0

a typical game consists of
veiwing mission orders and
making a plan. fitting out
 your team with weapons
and equipment. hopefully
fulfilling your orders, and
returning to the exit helipad
for a debriefing.

1. the title screen.
most of the options are
obvious, but a few need a bit
of explanation.
centre play will centre the
computer players who are
moving or firing when its the
computers turn. friendly

players are always centred.
seed is the random seed for
that game. things like agent
statistics are all random. the
same 10 letter word here will
give you the same game every
time.

2. the mission screen.
there are 8 missions which are
played in order. the next
mission can be chosen with a
click on the next mission icon
other icons display orders and
the mission map. allied units
and the exit helipad will be

flashing. once your objective
has been achieved you can
complete the mission by moving
remaining forces to the exit.

3. team selection screen.
here you equip team members
and veiw their statistics.
click one of the five agents
to display that agents details
each has a number of stats
represented by pictograms.
a brief description of

these follow...
heart .. life force. hits zap
this. when it hits 0 you die.
cash .. how much equipment you
can afford for that member.

fist .. combat skill ranges
from 3 to 10. determines how
often a shot hits the target.
runner .. mobility, squares to
move each go. maximum = 7.,0

shield .. defence factor
affects how often an enemy
shot will hit, not how much
damage is done.
to equip an agent, select the
weapon by clicking on
its name. cost, range and

damage is printed along with
a picture.
cost is how much that agents
cash will be reduced if he
carries that item. range is
the weapon range in
squares in between you and
the target, and damage is how

much damage is done on a
succesful hit.
range is measured horizontally
and vertically only. the range
to the target does affect your
shooting. the closer the
better chance of a hit.
click on the equip icon to

but an item. click on an item
that an agent holds and the
equip icon changes to discard.
click here to resell an item.
when all agents have been
equipped, click on the next
icon to start the game...

4. game play.	
first you move, the computer
moves then you fire and the
computer fires. the display
panel shows the following ...
the current agents portrait
and endurance level as a
double bar next to this.

weapons are listed below this,
followed by the arrows for
moving and detonation icons
and the panel ends with the
pass icon.
agents stats and a message bar
lies along the screen floor.

a. moving
either click on the arrows, on
an adjacent square or better
still, use the arrow keys on
the keyboard to move each man
in turn to end a move
prematurely or just to skip an
agent either click pass or

press space.
the computer then moves its
forces, if it wants to. if you
have a mine detector, hidden
mines appear if you stand
adjacent to them. they stay
revealed permanently.

there are also a few keyboard
options available here.
press m to call up the map
units are not shown, only the
terrain. press any key to turn
it off.
press s to toggle the music
on or off.

b. firing
first select a weapon by
clicking on its icon, and then
move the mouse on screen. if a
square is in range, a box will
appear around it, near to the
mouse pointer. note that
grenades have a fixed range of

five and no less. this means
they have to be aimed.
click on a square to fire.
bazookas and grenades cause an
explosion and guarantee a
hit on any enemies within.
when firing a normal gun or
knife, a check is made to see

if a hit happened. this uses
combat skill of the firer,
defence factor of the target
and a random factor to
determine a hit. the lasight
boosts the users combat skill
by 5 during use.
mine detectors and armour are

always active.
remex, remote controlled
explosives, are a bit special.
fire them in a nearby square
to plant them. when you are
clear of the area, either
click on the red icons near
the arrows to detonate or

press return.
any player can detonate, but
you must be in firing mode.
the computer then fires if
neccesary. the game is
completely fair to the
computer player and its team
has the same stats as yours,

so be careful. grenade lobs by
the computer can devastate a
team. write to me if you want
lists of the standard computer
agents equipment. there are 5
types of computer agent.
normal, big gun, elite,
android and captain. each

have different equipment specs
	
5. notes
armour will boost defence
factor by the its cost. the
maximum defence factor is 5.
to complete a mission you will
have to either kill a specific
number of enemy units, or
reduce a certain square to

rubble using explosives.
remex guarantees a kill of
anyone within range. press
escape during move or fire
phases to quit the mission
touch the edge of the screen
to scroll the display.

6. tips
plant remex on walls for a
deeper explosion. give low
combat skill agents lasights
or explosives. give accurifles
to agents with low mobility.
keep plenty of grenades and
stuff, don:t count on one man

to do the detonation work
because he might die. attack
in force. single agents stand
little chance. scroll ahead to
see enemy agents early.
have a plan.
stick together.

7. contact me
write to me if you want the
enemy intelligence algorithms,
enemy specifications, the
formats for the mission files,
the music modules or specific
routines. if you have any
suggestions for possible

sequels or if you would like
to see a full price version,
contact me too.
