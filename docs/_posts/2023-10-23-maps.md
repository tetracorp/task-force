### Unused test mission

This mission appears in the [deleted files](../analysis/deleted-files.html)
as `MISSION1`. It is a test version of the first mission with a blank mission
description, no objectives, and different placement for three squad members.

```
       OPERATION  TEST

### Map format technical data

Each mission file is 4,000 bytes, divided into five sections:

Length | Format           | Field
-------|------------------|-----------------------------------
    2  | 2 bytes          | Win condition
    2  | 2 bytes          | Always zero
   36  | 9 x 2 x 2 bytes  | Coordinates for mission targets.
  360  | 12 x 30 bytes    | Description. First line is title.
 3600  | 60 x 60 bytes    | Map, one byte per tile.

The first two bytes determine the win condition. They are read as a big-endian
two-byte word:

- If negative, it is the number of buildings you must destroy. In this case, the
  36 bytes are nine pairs of coordinates for the targets.
- If positive, it is the number of enemies you must kill. The 36 bytes are 36
  separate ID numbers of enemies, numbered in order they are added to the
  screen.
- If zero, you must kill all enemies to win.
- If equal to `$ACED`, the mission is already complete and you need only proceed
  to the exit.

The 360 bytes which follow are the map description in twelve 30-byte lines, each
line ending with `$00`. The first line of these is the mission title.

The remaining 3600 bytes is a 60x60 map. There are 72 tiles from `01` to `72`,
depicted below as rows of 10 starting at 0.

An interesting quirk of the map design is that since enemies are placed as map
tiles, the terrain each enemy stands on starts out undefined. The game has a
special function to determine which tile should be underneath each soldier based
on the most common tile around them. From that point on, each soldier stores the
terrain they're standing on as a byte, and the game keeps track of this when
they move.
