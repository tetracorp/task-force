### Map format technical data

Each mission file is 4,000 bytes, divided into five sections:

Length | Format           | Field
-------|------------------|-----------------------------------
    2  | 2 bytes          | Win condition
    2  | 2 bytes          | Always zero
   36  | 9 x 2 x 2 bytes  | Coordinates for mission targets.
  360  | 12 x 30 bytes    | Description. First line is title.
 3600  | 60 x 60 bytes    | Map, one byte per tile.

The first two bytes determine the win condition. They are read as a big-endian
two-byte word:

- If negative, it is the number of buildings you must destroy. In this case, the
  36 bytes are nine pairs of coordinates for the targets.
- If positive, it is the number of enemies you must kill. The 36 bytes are 36
  separate ID numbers of enemies, numbered in order they are added to the
  screen.
- If equal to `$ACED`, the mission is already complete and you need only proceed
  to the exit.

The 360 bytes which follow are the map description in twelve 30-byte lines, each
line ending with `$00`. The first line of these is the mission title.

The remaining 3600 bytes is a 60x60 map. There are 72 tiles from `01` to `72`,
depicted below as rows of 10 starting at 0.
